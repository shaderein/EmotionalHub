# MyBooksApp

This is a simple application we build during lectures in fall 2020 OOSE class together to practice with various concepts and technologies. This 
is a web app conforming to Client-Server Architecture where user(s) can store their favorite books and authors. The app
will store data in a database and its backend functionalities are implemented as RESTful API end-points.

## HW5

The front-end of add_book and add_author was furnished to support book/author insertion. Additional delete-book button was added to 
operate on the book database. Additional validations were conducted to check if the author names contain two parts (first name + last
name), if the isbn is in correct format, and if there exist some special characters in other fields.

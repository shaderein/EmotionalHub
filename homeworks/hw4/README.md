# MyBooksApp

This is a simple application we build during lectures in fall 2020 OOSE class together to practice with various concepts and technologies. In this homework, we 
will be adding new views in the MyBooksApp by rendering simple HTML Pages using Apache Velocity template engine.We will also practice with http cookies. 
This is a web app conforming to Client-Server Architecture where user(s) can store their favorite books and authors. The app
will store data in a database and its backend functionalities are implemented as RESTful API end-points.

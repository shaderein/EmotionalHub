# MyBooksApp

This is a simple application we build during lectures in fall 2020 OOSE class together to practice with various concepts and technologies. This 
is a web app conforming to Client-Server Architecture where user(s) can store/access their favorite books and authors. The app
will store data in a database and its backend functionalities are implemented as RESTful API end-points.

## Homework 3 

RESTful API endpoints were built using local addresses to add, list, and delete authors and books from our database 
built in our last homework. These endpoints are tested using JUnit tests, which check that the endpoint is functional as
the server application runs, as well as whether database operations are executed successfully.
